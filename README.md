<h1 align="center">Coders Quotes Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://connall1234.github.io/fistprojectforcodein/)

Here's my website, Coders Quotes! 

This website is built with the purpose of showing which quotes I find the most interesting, from different figures throughout the world. The website is designed in a black & white manner to elicit simplicity and strightforwardness. 

The website is easily designed with a simple layout, so anyone can access it easily. The website consists of a home/about page, a page dedicated to the quotes mentioned above, and lastly a form page where anyone can post and send their own favourite quotes in.
